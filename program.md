 **Confirmed Plenary Speakers**   
 
*Dr. Emma Sherratt, University of Adelaide* 

My main research focus is in Macroevolution - to identify the patterns and infer processes underlying morphological diversity, by choosing biologically diverse systems and formulating research hypotheses that can be tested quantitatively. In general, I apply a suite of statistical tools to measure variation in form, specifically size and shape of morphological structures, within a comparative framework. Predominantly, I use X-Ray Micro Computed Tomography and surface scanning technology to gather three-dimensional representations of an organism's anatomy, and traditional and geometric morphometrics to quantify and study variation in morphological traits. 
   

*Dr. Michael Whitehead, University of Melbourne*   

My research aims to see the world from a plant’s perspective, to better understand not only plant ecology, but also the behaviour and ecology of the animals and fungi with which they interact. I work on some of the most fascinating examples of plant evolution in some of the world’s most renowned hotspots for plant biodiversity. For example, I have worked on sexual mimicry in Australian orchids, specialized orchid-fungi relationships in south-west Australia, and the incredible long-tongue fly of South Africa.

My discoveries contribute to a basic understanding of how plant biodiversity is generated and maintained, how plants influence their interacting partners, and how landscape and ecology combine to influence plant evolution across space and time.
