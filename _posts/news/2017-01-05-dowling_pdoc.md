Research in [Damian Dowling's](www.damiandowlinglab.com) laboratory is focused on the role the mitochondrial genome plays in evolutionary adaptation and in the evolution of sex differences. Maternal inheritance of the mitochondrial genome renders the mitochondrial DNA vulnerable to the accumulation of mutations that are harmful to males, but neutral or beneficial to females.

We seek a talented and highly-motivated postdoctoral researcher to join our laboratory group, to study the contribution that mitochondrial genetic variation makes to mediating sex-specific trajectories of life-history evolution. The project will integrate experimental techniques in evolutionary ecology, genomics and evolutionary physiology.

The closing date for applications is **January 18th.** Please see [this flyer]({{ site.url }}/docs/dowling_pdoc.pdf) for full details.
