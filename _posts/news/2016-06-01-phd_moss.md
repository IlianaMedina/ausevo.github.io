A motivated student is sought for an exciting PhD project on Antarctic mosses. The project will use genetic techniques (exon capture) to look at the evolutionary history of mosses in Antarctica, including whether volcanoes allowed them to survive past ice ages on the icy continent, and whether they can effectively disperse long distances. Some field work in Antarctica may be possible as part of this project, but many samples are already available, ensuring initial results can be obtained rapidly regardless of field opportunities. The student should have a background in biology, an interest in Antarctic science, and first-class Honours or equivalent. The project will be based at the [Australian National University](http://www.anu.edu.au) in Canberra. Students interested in applying for this PhD should send academic transcripts, CV and contact details of two referees to [Dr Ceridwen Fraser](http://ceridwenfraser.wix.com/ceridwen-fraser) via email (ceridwen.fraser[at]anu.edu.au)
