**PhD Project Commencing 2018**

The Stuart-Fox lab is seeking a PhD student to join an interdisciplinary project involving thermal adaptations, colour, near-infrared reflectance properties, and nano-structures in beetles. The project is funded by the Hermon Slade Foundation and the University of Melbourne. We are particularly keen to recruit students with a background or interest in the interface between biology and optical physics.
 
**Project description**  
Animals have evolved remarkable and unique ways of controlling light (e.g. fluorescence, iridescence). Until now, biologists have focused almost exclusively on how ultraviolet (UV) and human-visible wavelengths are manipulated to produce the diversity of colours and optical effects we see in nature. However, the way near-infrared wavelengths of sunlight are controlled to affect body temperature is critical to survival; yet the adaptive significance of near-infrared variation remains almost entirely unexplored in animals. 
 
This project will characterise near-infrared variation in leaf beetles (_Chrysomelidae_) and reveal its adaptive significance using experimental approaches. The project will also reveal how the nano-scale architectures of beetle cuticles control UV-visible and near-infrared light, enabling them to balance camouflage, communication and thermal requirements. Discovery of nano-structures to manipulate near-infrared light has exciting potential biomimetic applications.
 
**Requirements**  
Successful applicants will be assisted in applying for an Australian Postgraduate Award (for Australians) or an International Postgraduate Research Scholarship (for Internationals) through the University of Melbourne. To be competitive, a First-class Honours or Masters Degree (or international equivalent) or publication in international journals are essential. Please send applications by **1st October or earlier**.
 
To apply, please send A) A brief letter outlining your research interests; B) a CV, C) your academic transcript/grades, D) contact details of two referees (including a previous research supervisor). For further information, and to submit applications, please contact:
