A PhD project is available from 2018 in [David Chapple’s Evolutionary Ecology of Environmental Change research group](https://sites.google.com/site/chapplelab/) at Monash University. The Chapple Lab uses field studies, field- and lab-based experiments, comparative analyses, morphological analyses and molecular approaches to examine the impact of past, current, and future environmental change on phenotype, life-history and distribution, with squamate reptiles as model systems.


The successful student will be able to develop a project in one the lab’s two main research areas:
- Behavioural and Evolutionary Ecology of the Delicate skink (Lampropholis delicata).
- Lizard Macroecology.
