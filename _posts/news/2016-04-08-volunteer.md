I am looking for dedicated field assistants to help monitor a population of red-winged fairy-wrens in south-west Australia from 10 October 2016 to 16 January 2017 as part of an on-going study on cooperation and competition. The study is based at Smithbrook Nature Reserve in one of the 35 biodiversity hotspots of the world!

Working days are long, start early and consist of lots of hiking through dense forest with occasional encounters with venomous snakes. Applicants must be physically fit and have outstanding hearing and vision, be able to work independently, get along well with others in remote field setting and tolerate hot weather conditions. Enthusiasm, self-motivation, and a strong work ethic are a must.

**Required qualifications:** experience in monitoring colour-ringed birds, nest-searching, mist netting and current drivers licence. Field assistant will get an allowance of AU$7000 for total period. Onsite accommodation is provided, but candidate must pay their own flight to Perth, Australia. Candidate must be Australian citizen or eligible for appropriate visa e.g. subclass 417, 600 or 601.
