An exciting opportunity is available for a highly motivated student to join the [Eucalypt Genetics Group](http://www.eucalyptgenetics.com/) at UTAS in a new project that uses state-of-the-art genomic technologies to characterise genomic regions important for speciation and adaptation in Australia’s iconic eucalypts. The project will investigate the importance of hybridisation between species, especially during range expansion and contraction. Up to $30,000 in running costs will be funded by a recently awarded ARC Discovery Grant.

A major international effort has recently seen a eucalypt become the second forest tree genome sequenced. The PhD project links the expanding international knowledge on the eucalypt genome to the evolutionary dynamics of wild populations in Australia to provide insights into the nature of species and processes which have shaped their evolution. These insights can inform their breeding as well as their conservation and management in Australia.

The project will be embedded in the [Eucalypt Genetics Group](http://www.eucalyptgenetics.com/) at UTAS (led by Profs [Brad Potts](http://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/plant-science/Brad-Potts) and [René Vaillancourt](http://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/plant-science/rene-vaillancourt)) which has a world-class interdisciplinary research programme that investigates the evolutionary and ecological forces that shape diversity in Eucalyptus. The project is based in Hobart which offers an excellent lifestyle with stunning wilderness areas nearby, a vibrant arts and boutique food culture and affordable living expenses compared with other Australian capital cities.

To apply, please email a brief summary of research interests along with a CV and the contact details for at least two referees. Applications will be assessed on an ongoing basis. Students with an excellent academic background and enthusiasm will be invited to apply to UTAS for a competitive APA Scholarship (open until **16 October 2016**). International students will need to apply for a UTAS International Scholarship, or through another program (e.g. Endeavour, or a scheme in the applicant's home country). To rank highly in these scholarship rounds, students will need to have completed a Masters by Research (or international equivalent) or first class Honours (domestic students), and have at least one publication.
