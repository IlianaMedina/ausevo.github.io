**Expressions of interest for potential Ph.D. projects at the Evolutionary and Sensory Ecology Lab, The University of Sydney**

**Projects:** The [Evolutionary and Sensory Ecology Lab](https://www.tomwhite.io) at The University of Sydney is seeking expressions of interest from enthusiastic students looking to pursue a PhD. Potential topics are diverse, though well-defined projects exist around questions of (1) the evolution and ecology of dynamic visual communication, using model butterflies (2) the coevolution of sensory systems and visual signals, combining broad-scale field work and experimental evolution, and (3) the optics, function, and evolution of iridescence. Students will be strongly encouraged to develop their own research agendas within these broader contexts, and will ultimately integrate observational, experimental, and theoretical approaches to test evolutionary theory.

**Location:** [The University of Sydney](https://sydney.edu.au) is a world-class research institution, and one of the top-ranked universities in Australia. It is home to outstanding researchers and facilities, and the candidate will be able to make full use of the resources at hand, while pursuing the rich opportunities for collaboration within the university, its immediate surrounds, and abroad. 

**Requirements:** Suitable candidates will be highly motivated, with some previous experience in research. The successful applicant(s) will be supported in applying for a Research Training Program scholarship (formerly the Australian Postgraduate Award) and the Universityâ€™s equivalent, which share an application. See [the university website](http://sydney.edu.au/scholarships/research/research-training-program.shtml) for full details of the requirements and application process. Scholarships are highly competitive, and a first-class Honours or Masters Degree (or international equivalent) and/or publication in a recognised scientific journal is essential. 

**Expressions of interest:** To apply, please send (1) a brief statement of research interests & aspirations, (2) a CV, and (3) the contact details of two referees directly to Thomas White (thomas.white[at]sydney.edu.au) by **August 20**. Though scholarships are now offered on a continuous basis year-round, full applications are due in October for projects beginnings in February 2019.
