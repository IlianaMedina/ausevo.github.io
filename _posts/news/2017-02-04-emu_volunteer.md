As part of a project on the mating system of the emu, [Julia Ryeland](http://juliaryeland.weebly.com) from the Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment is calling for volunteers to assist in three separate aspects of the project. A brief description of each aspect is detailed on the attached flyers, as well as details of how you can be involved. Please feel free to further advertise this to whomever you think may be interested, and donâ€™t hesitate to email ([Julia.Ryeland[at]westernsydney.edu.au](mailto:Julia.Ryeland@westernsydney.edu.au)) if you have any further questions.
