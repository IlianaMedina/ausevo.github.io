Three PhD opportunities are available on projects investigating pre-and post-copulatory sexual performance of Queensland fruit fly (_Bactrocera tryoni_, aka ‘Qfly’). Each of these projects is part of a significant collaboration between Macquarie University’s Department of Biological Sciences and Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).
Projects include:

1. Polyandry and paternity patterns,
2. Mediation of mating-induced sexual inhibition
3. Genetics and genomics of reproductive fitness

Enquiries are welcome, and interested applicants are encouraged to make initial informal contact before applying. Interested applicants should email a letter of interest, academic transcripts, curriculum vitae and the names and contact information of three referees to Prof Phil Taylor (Phil.Taylor[at]mq.edu.au).
