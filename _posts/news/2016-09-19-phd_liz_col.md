We are seeking a PhD student to work on an ARC-funded project starting in 2017, investigating how stress affects both pigment deposition and nano-structures of cells and tissues which together produce colour.

The mechanisms underlying colour production have fundamental implications for the costs and constraints on colour signals. This project will investigate how diverse colours are produced in reptiles and the information these colours convey about individual health, condition and performance.

This PhD project provides opportunity to develop a broad range of skills including electron microscopy, pigment biochemistry, endocrinology, optical modelling, and experience working on lizards in the field and laboratory. There is scope to pursue your own questions, within the broad framework of the project.

You will need to obtain an Australian Postgraduate Award (APA; $25,849 per year, or an IPRS for international students) through The University of Melbourne; therefore a first-class Honours or Masters Degree is essential.

Interested applicants please submit: a brief cover letter outlining your research interests; a comprehensive CV; academic transcript, and contact details of two referees (including a previous research supervisor).

**Closing date for applications is 15th October 2016**
