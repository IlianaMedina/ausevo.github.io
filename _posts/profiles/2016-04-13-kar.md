**Who are you, and what do you do?**

I am a Behavioural Ecologist and a Masters of Research graduate from Macquarie University. I am currently juggling my time working as a lab demonstrator; research assistant and lab manager for [A/Prof Martin Whiting](http://whitinglab.com/) and [Dr. Daniel Noble](http://nobledan.com/)

**How did you come to be a biologist?**

As a kid, I loved watching David Attenborough describe bizarre animal behaviours in BBC documentaries. Check out [my favourite clip!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPbWJPsBPdA&nohtml5=False). When I found out that the science behind these documentaries was the work of amazing biologists, I knew exactly what I wanted to do.

**Who else's work do you enjoy, and why?**

I really enjoy [Douglas Emlenâ€™s](http://hs.umt.edu/dbs/labs/emlen/). He recently presented a new theory of the evolution of exaggerated weaponry at Behaviour 2015  and it was just fascinating!

**If time and money were no object, what would you pursue?**

I would invent a device that enables me to communicate with animals, how convenient would that be!?
